Operator	Description	Example
==	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.

!=	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true.

>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.

<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.

>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.

<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.

<=>	Combined comparison operator. Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second.	(a <=> b) returns -1.

===	Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.	(1...10) === 5 returns true.
.eql?	True if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values.	1 == 1.0 returns true, but 1.eql?(1.0) is false.

equal?	True if the receiver and argument have the same object id.	if aObj is duplicate of bObj then aObj == bObj is true, a.equal?bObj is false but a.equal?aObj is true.

Ruby Assignment Operators
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then âˆ’

Operator	Description	Example
=	Simple assignment operator, assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.	c = a + b will assign the value of a + b into c

+=	Add AND assignment operator, adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	c += a is equivalent to c = c + a

-=	Subtract AND assignment operator, subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a

*=	Multiply AND assignment operator, multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a

/=	Divide AND assignment operator, divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand.	c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a

%=	Modulus AND assignment operator, takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand.	c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a

**=	Exponent AND assignment operator, performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand.	c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a
